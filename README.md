See [issues](https://github.com/iambrj/eopl/issues). In particular, I would
appreciate it if someone is willing to rewrite the following using [Racket's
`match`](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/match.html)

1. [Arithmetic](./src/arithmetic)
2. [Lexical](./src/lexical)
3. [Functional](./src/functional)
4. [Recursive](./src/recursive)
